# Information Architecture

For our purposes, we use a template to create information architecture diagrams, which include a title page, 
and consistent headers and project labels. The main goal of any information architecture is to clearly define 
the page hierarchy and order of a website. If blocks of content are included in the architecture diagram, 
their design and placement should clearly indicate that they are different from pages. Consistent numbering 
of items and tiers is critical for the entire team to understand the siteâ€™s organization and the work ahead 
of them in creating the content and building the site.
