# Grid System

(Still being determined)

Supporting mobile first design standards and responsive layouts following [media breakpoints](/guidelines/media-breakpoints "Design Standards, Media Breakpoints").

## Grid Container Classes:

Class naming convertions are `grid-` + `container-` + `container orientation`. There are two possible orientations, **Columns** or **Rows**.

`grid-container-col` contain elements that stack in a **vertical column**.

`grid-container-row` contain elements that are lined-up in a **horizontal row**.

A html `<div>` with a class of `grid-container-row` and `grid-container_fixed-width` will give you a container that is centered with in the browser window as defined
by media [media breakpoint gutter](/guidelines/media-breakpoints#gutter "Design Standards, Media Breakpoint Gutters") values.

### Basic usage

#### HTML

```
<div class="main">
  <div class="grid-container-row grid-container_fixed-width">
   <div class="grid-1-3">column 1 of 3</div>
   <div class="grid-1-3">column 2 of 3</div>
   <div class="grid-1-3">column 3 of 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Inner Grid Classes

Responsive grid widths need to be nested within a container class to work properly. Specifically a `grid-container-row` since the following
grid classes define horizonal widths as percetages of a total. As the total width of the grid container shrinks, inner grid columns begin to stake.
A 12 column grid will shift to a 8 column grid, halving from there down to 2 total columns. This responsive process is defined by
[media breakpoints](/guidelines/media-breakpoints "Design Standards, Media Breakpoints").

Class naming convertions are `grid-` + `unit-` + `of total units`.

The following Grid Column Widths are supported:

| Grid       | Unit | Total | Class       |
| -----------| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 12 columns |   1  |   12  | `grid-1-12` |
| 11 columns |   1  |   11  | `grid-1-11` |
| 10 columns |   1  |   10  | `grid-1-10` |
| 9 columns  |   1  |    9  | `grid-1-9`  |
| 8 columns  |   1  |    8  | `grid-1-8`  |
| 7 columns  |   1  |    7  | `grid-1-7`  |
| 6 columns  |   1  |    6  | `grid-1-6`  |
| 5 columns  |   1  |    5  | `grid-1-5`  |
| 4 columns  |   1  |    4  | `grid-1-4`  |
| 3 columns  |   1  |    3  | `grid-1-3`  |
| 2 columns  |   1  |    2  | `grid-1-2`  |
| 1 columns  |   1  |    1  | `grid-1-1`  |
