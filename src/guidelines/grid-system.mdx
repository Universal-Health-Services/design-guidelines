# Grid System

The grid system is made of *container* classes, defining rows or columns, and nested *width* classes. The *grid system* 
supports mobile first design standards and responsive layouts following [*media breakpoints*](/guidelines/media-breakpoints 
"Design Standards, Media Breakpoints"). *Media breakpoints* define the logic for which a layout adapts to specific screen sizes.

## Properties
---

All *grid system* classes start with `grid-`.

### *Container* Classes

Grid system *container* classes wrap or contain smaller units of the grid system. There can be 
containers within containers, containers wrapping columns of a specific size or containers that 
only have simple content elements such as a paragraph, `<p>I am a paragraphy</p>`. *Container* 
classes are powerful and can be confussing. To better understand what a container does look at 
the way one is named.

#### Naming Conventions 

*Container* classes are named `grid-` + `container-` + `container orientation`. There are two possible 
orientations, *columns* `col` or *rows* `row`. The class `grid-container-col` contain elements that stack in 
a **vertical column**. A `grid-container-row` class contain elements that are lined-up in a **horizontal row**.

#### *Fixed Width* containers

By default any container class does not have a defined width, that is what a [*width* class](#width-classes "jump to: Width Classes") is for. 
Defining a container as *fixed width* will create a content container that will remain cantered within a page while following responsive 
grid scaling rules.

A html `<div>` with a class of `grid-container-row` and `grid-container_fixed-width` will give you 
a container that is centered with in the browser window as defined by  media [media breakpoint 
gutter](/guidelines/media-breakpoints#gutter "Design Standards, Media Breakpoint Gutters") values.

### *Width* Classes

Responsive grid *widths* need to be nested within a *container* class to work properly. Specifically a 
`grid-container-row` since the following grid classes define horizonal widths as percetages of the 
total browser window width. As the total width of the grid container shrinks, inner grid columns scale and stack 
appropirately. A 12 column grid will shift to a 8 column grid, then halving until the grid only contains 2 total 
columns. This responsive process is defined by [media breakpoints](/guidelines/media-breakpoints 
"Design Standards, Media Breakpoints").

#### Naming Conventions

`grid-` + `unit-` + `of total units`.


The following Grid Column Widths are supported:

| Grid       | Unit | Total | Class       |
| -----------| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 12 columns |   1  |   12  | `grid-1-12` |
| 11 columns |   1  |   11  | `grid-1-11` |
| 10 columns |   1  |   10  | `grid-1-10` |
| 9 columns  |   1  |    9  | `grid-1-9`  |
| 8 columns  |   1  |    8  | `grid-1-8`  |
| 7 columns  |   1  |    7  | `grid-1-7`  |
| 6 columns  |   1  |    6  | `grid-1-6`  |
| 5 columns  |   1  |    5  | `grid-1-5`  |
| 4 columns  |   1  |    4  | `grid-1-4`  |
| 3 columns  |   1  |    3  | `grid-1-3`  |
| 2 columns  |   1  |    2  | `grid-1-2`  |
| 1 columns  |   1  |    1  | `grid-1-1`  |
