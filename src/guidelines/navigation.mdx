# Navigation

Most general description of Navigation here. For mobile navigation, the goal is to eliminate clutter and provide clear options that are 
easy for users to click on with fingers.

## Properties
---

### Mobile

* Hamburger menus should include the label "Menu"
* For the close action to go back to the regular site view (in the case of drawer or overlay navigation), 
use a button with the label "Close"
* Tapping on the search bar should bring up the native keyboard with "Go" button, so no "Search" or 
"Enter" button is needed in the design (to save space)
* Hiding the logo in the mobile navigation is ok to save space
* Tapping on a menu item should take you to that page (not the submenu as it does now in AC sites)
* Color consistency should be maintained for parent and child items, as well as active pages

* Accordions in Mobile Navigation
	- The active page should have a defined style that is different than the rest of the menu items
	- All child items should be expanded from the active page by default
	- If there's an action a user must take to change the element (to expand it for example), then it should 
	be clear that the action is possible, and where the active area is to take initiate the action
	- If Accordion sections are links, that should be clearly indicated

### Header

(Different for Acute/BH)

The header area of any website is the most valuable and familiar area to users. Therefore 
this space should be used for navigation elements and contact phone numbers, the most useful 
and valuable content on our websites.

* Use consistent colors to match overall site theme
* Make the text in the header, body and button as concise as possible

#### Utility

* Very top bar area
* contains Utility navigation
* Search bars should be included on every one of our sites, placed prominently in the header area, usually in the utility navigation.

_Note:_ Rationale for what goes in main navigation vs. utility navigation - flesh out with details/description

#### Main

* Below the top bar in the header area
* Should be larger than the *Top Bar* > *Utility Navigation*

_Note:_ Rationale for what goes in main navigation vs. utility navigation - flesh out with details/description

#### Sub-navigation

##### Mega Menu

* *Main Navigation* > *Mega-menu*

##### Sidebar

* Page layout, main content area > Left or Right column
* Line height should be 1.2rem or less to make it clear what items are separate or have line breaks
* Labels written in [Title Case](https://definition.com "Reference Link: here")
* Provide an easy way to get back to the main landing page for that section

#### Calls-to-Action

Calls-to-Action, or CTAs are used widely throughout our sites. They are usually composed of a header and a button, 
sometimes with additional text and a colored or photo background.

* Other navigation elements within page layouts
* If multiple styles of CTA blocks are an option, make sure there is a clear hierarchy for when they are used

### Footer

* Located at the bottom of page
* Elements contained:
    * Legal text/copyright
	* Footer nav/menu
	* Social menu (optional)
	* Logo
	* Contact (location/phone/etc)
* Include an address that is linked to google map address in mobile view
* Include phone number linked for mobile view
* Social media if applicable
* Acute Sites, Include UHS Logo

_Note_ - in the Drupal dashboard of the Acute Care sites, the footer navigation menu is referred to as "secondary navigation".

#### Disclaimer

Legal notices and copyright should be included on all sites. These may include links to the following:

* HIPAA Statement
* Physician Disclaimer
* Privacy Policy
* Nondiscrimination Notice

## Best Practices
---

Best practices here.

### Header

* Aim for a maximum 7 menu items
* Labels written in [Title Case](https://definition.com "Reference Link: here")
* Hover state defined with more than a color change (indicator, underline, outline, etc)
* Provide an easy exit from the search function
* If using a hidden search bar, include a functionality that reveals the bar when the search 
icon is clicked, or appears  in a drawer under the utility navigation
* Consider not hiding the search bar at all

#### Mobile

* Use a drawer or full-page design
* Place the search bar in top bar area of the mobile menu, and utility navigation at the bottom
* Within a child page or section, rather than using the label "Back" to view the parent item, label 
the button with the name of the specific parent page or section.

#### Utility

* Consider how many items/how much space it takes up, especially in relation to the main navigation
* Aim for maximum of 5 items
* Labels written in [Title Case](https://definition.com "Reference Link: here") or [Sentence 
case](https://definition.com "Reference Link: here")

#### Things to Avoid

* Ampersands (if size permits, if navigation is too close to logo or not fitting within 
breakpoints, ampersands are ok)
* External links (as discussed in Links section below). If an external link must be used in a 
main navigation, it should have an indicator (icon, etc) that it is external
* Labels with line breaks. If a menu item must have a line break, line height should be 1.1-1.2rems, 
with more space between separate items to make it clear that the item with the break belongs together
* Megamenu that cannot display all of the items on the screen and requires the user to scroll
* Icons or other visuals that add visual clutter
