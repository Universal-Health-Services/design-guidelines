# Text Elements

Most general description of Text Elements here.

## Properties
---

### Default Style

The default style of Call-Out Boxes should be with a color background. Adding a simple border 
(which is an option in the WYSIWYG settings) doesn’t emphasize the text as well as a different 
background. Because call-outs are meant to break up the text, they should not be placed next 
to other call-outs or horizontal lines within the page. The call-out should be able to stand 
on its own to emphasize or define sections of body copy.

### Call-Out Boxes

An element we’ve used on our drupal-based Acute Care sites has been a Call-Out Box. These 
elements are just a version of a call-to-action meant to draw attention to specific links 
or highlight information within a page. These elements use a different color background or 
adds a border around a block of text for emphasis. These can be a useful way to break up 
information on a page and direct user’s attention to important details. There are several 
considerations for when and how to use them, especially in relation to other elements on a page.

When using call-outs or horizontal lines, keep the style consistent throughout the site. It's ok 
to use more than one style, but be sure that the styles are used in a meaningful way. If there 
is no distinction about when a solid horizontal line is used compared to a dotted line, or one 
color Call-Out Box is used rather than another, then only one style is needed. Avoid using Call-Out 
Boxes, headers, horizontal lines, and images in close proximity to each other which can make a 
page seem cluttered.

Call-Out Boxes, like CTAs should not include run-on or multiple sentences, and any buttons or 
links included with them should follow our other guidelines to be as concise as possible.

In instances where there are multiple CTA blocks being used to link out to other pages, consider 
creating a sub-navigation area with card elements instead.

### Use of Bold

Bold text should be used to emphasize a few key words in a sentence. If an entire sentence seems to need 
emphasis, consider using a Call-Out Box instead. Use of bold in headers should be avoided.

Where bold text will be used frequently, the designer should consider defining a specific CSS class 
with weight and size.

### Columns

Columns should be added to page layouts where long lists are used. Consider using columns when you have 
a list that gets to be over 10 items long. The mobile view of columns should always be specified to stack 
rather than shrink, to ensure that users can read the text easily.

### Tables

Table columns should follow specific rules for justifying content to ensure maximum readability. Left 
columns should be left-aligned, right columns should be right aligned. Centered text within cells should 
be avoided. When cell content includes numbers, the commas should be aligned within the column to make 
it easier to compare the data.

### Bullets

Bulleted lists are also called unordered lists in html. They are composed of the unordered list tags, 
and the individual list item tags. Our default style for bulleted lists is for them to align with 
body copy. This is not how  tags are usually styled, so it will need to be manually defined. For each 
bulleted item, the paragraph spacing should be the same as body copy so that if the text breaks to a 
separate line, it is easy for users to determine that it's still one bullet. Spacing between bulleted 
items should be slightly more than body copy, to help differentiate the difference between the bulleted 
items, even if one or more breaks to a second line.

### Phone Numbers

For our purposes, phone numbers should use dashes to separate sections; not parentheses, spaces, 
periods, or other special characters. Phone numbers should also have a link applied in mobile views 
so that users can easily initiate a phone call from the linked number.

### Addresses

Addresses should have the title of the building or location in bold.

Linking the location title to either the location's website or the google maps location may make 
sense based on the overall page content and goals.

If the website for a location is included with the address, our preference is for it to be linked 
in a separate line, with a label such as "Visit Website", not have the location title linked to 
the website, due to the separate linking mentioned above to the map location.

### Special Characters

There are several special characters we often use on our sites, including the ©, ®, and ™ symbols.

For the ® and ™ symbols, they should be displayed as superscript. To do this in html, use the 
`<sup>``</sup>` tags around each.

In making our designs as usable as possible for users of screen readers, keep in mind that not 
all special characters are read appropriately by screen readers. The following list of characters 
are read correctly by the top 2 screen readers:

* @ (the at symbol)
* & (ampersand, written either as & or `&amp;` in the markup)
* / (slash)
* © (copyright, written as `&copy;`)
* ® (registered, written as `&reg;`)
* ™ (trademark, written as `&trade;`)
* ¶ (paragraph, written as `&para;`)
* • (bullet, written as `&#8226;`)
* $ (dollar)
* € (Euro, written as `&#8364;`)
* £ (British pound, written as `&pound;`)
* ¥ (Yen, written as `&yen;`)
* % (percent)
* ½ (one half, written as `&frac12;`)
* ¼ (one fourth, written as `&frac14;`)
* ¾ (three fourths, written as `&frac34;`)
* ° (degrees, written as `&deg;`)

### Non-breaking space
When using a special character, or an unusual phrase with spaces, consider using a non-breaking space if the character or phrase might break across two lines. With a non-breaking space, the entire word or phrase can be kept together to facilitate easier reading for the user.

## Best Practices
---

Best practices a.k.a. Recommendations here.

### Columns

* Left justify the left column
* Right justify the right column
* Make sure columns with numbers that use a comma align the commas
* Mobile design first is essential - stacking of columns from within a table is useless since users can't 
compare the rows to each other. Consider scaling or using tabs to break up the parts of the table for 
mobile views.
