# Links

When using links within a body of text, we strive to provide clarity to the user about the content 
of the link, its location, and status. The general text usability guidelines from above also apply.

## Properties
---

* *Labels* should be written in [Sentence case](https://definition.com "Reference Link: here")
* The link's *label* should describe the content of the link, not use generic *label* such as "click here"

### Links with Icons

Icons should be used sparingly with linked text. Acceptable uses of icons include an indicator for a 
"Contact Us" link to *email* or a *contact form*, or a *pdf* icon to indicate a linked document to download. 

If an icon is used, a non-breaking space `&nbsp;` should also be used between the label text and icon, 
so that the link wraps as one entity within text in responsive views. Any use of an icon should be 
accompanied by a text label within the html tag for accessibility.

### Indicator States

Links should have a specified global hover state. It's up to the designer what the state should be (underline, change 
in color). An additional state for visited links should also be defined whenever possible. Sometimes color 
modifications aren't enough of a change to indicate where a link is present, which is why underlines can be useful.

### External Links

Links that take a user to another site should indicate this whenever possible, with an icon or with 
descriptive text. When the link goes to another website, it is ok to use a shortened url as the label, 
not the full url (as in [http://www.cerner.com/](http://www.cerner.com/)). Avoid using 
external links in main navigation.

### Making Links Accessible

There are situations when the link label isn't as descriptive as possible, or using an icon with a link makes the most 
sense but then needs extra configuration to make it fully accessible. There are several options to make links (and other 
html elements) more accessible. For most elements, the attribute `aria-label` and `title` can be added to provide 
additional detail that is read by screen readers. The `title` attribute will also display a tooltip label on mouse hover. 
Another option that is slightly less desirable, is to add text with the class "sr-only`, which is invisible to regular 
users, but will be read by screen readers.

Remember to:

* Add an `aria-label` tag to further clarify the content of a link for users with assistive technology, further 
description and quick example needed.

### *Label* Naming Conventions

If possible, use the actual name of the linked item should be the link's *label* text. The *label* "Read more" can be used, 
but only where a description of the linked content is provided nearby. Avoid using full url as a *label* for a link.

* If an icon is used, a non-breaking space `&nbsp;` should also be used between the link's *label* text and icon

### Things to Avoid

* Make labels as brief as possible, the label should **not** be a full sentence.
