# Animations

Animations can add visual appeal and engagement on websites, but should be used thoughtfully. Hover states are a great place to 
use animations, for example to zoom in or out on images, or to add a drop-shadow to card elements. When animation is applied, 
we recommend using easing to transition between states.

When applying animation effects in Wordpress, we use normal speed, not slow, and more subtle actions such as sliding or zooming, 
not flashy or jarring actions such as spinning images, somersaulting, etc. For large blocks of text, don’t apply animations as 
the moving text can make people queasy and is annoying because it is hard to read.
