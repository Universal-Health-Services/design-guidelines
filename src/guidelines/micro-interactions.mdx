# Micro Interactions

Micro-interactions are subtle animations to show status around one main task or element. They can be a good way to clarify the next state and ease users into it. An example we use on our sites is the animation of a drawer or overlay mobile menu. Another example is a progress wheel that shows a form being submitted by a user, and displays a checkbox when the submission is complete.

Consider using micro-interactions to add subtle feedback for users on our sites about the actions they take.
