# Typography

## Universal Requirements
<ul>
<li>Use base font of 16-18pt size (18pt preferred)</li>
<li>Set headers in Rems following a scale with 2pts or more between sizes</li>
<li>Specify at least H1-H3 font sizes for the project</li>
<li>Body copy color should have enough contrast to meet AA standard</li>
<li>Prioritize maximum readability/legibility in typeface selection for our projects</li>
</ul>

## Recommendations

<ul>
<li>Set line height of body copy to be 1.6-1.65rems (using the golden ratio)</li>
<li>Use open source or google fonts that are readily available on all devices</li>
</ul>

## Units
<p>For the purposes of our web designs, we use Rems as the unit for font size. To understand why, it’s best to start with some basic definitions.</p>

<p>*Pixels:* An abbreviation of “picture element” pixels are the smallest element in a digital image. The size of this element depends on the resolution of an image, and therefore is not ideal for determining consistent font size.
*Points:* A unit of measure specific to font size, originally used to measure font height. 1 point is exactly equal to the 1/72nd of an inch.
*Ems:* A unit of measure of the width of a font size, originally referencing the width of the “m” within the typeface/font size. Ems are used as a reference of the base font size, so if a font is set to be 16pt, 1 em = 16 pt.
*Rems:* “Responsive” or “root” ems reference a root html element of a document or website rather than referencing an element on a page as Ems do.</p>

<p>Rems and ems are scalable on a web pages, where pixels or points are not. If the font size is set in Ems or Rems on a website, users can adjust the size in their browser to suit their needs. Ems, however, reference the element they are applied to within a page and are subject to inheriting styles from parent elements. Rems on the other hand, reference a root element that is consistent across the entire website, which is why Rems are preferable.</p>

<p>The Rem or root size of the body copy should be set within the stylesheet in points, and then a specific scale for header sizes can be defined based on ratios of Rems (3.2, 2.5, etc) for consistency throughout a website.</p>
